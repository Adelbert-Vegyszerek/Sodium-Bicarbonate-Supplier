Why Sodium Bicarbonate (Feed Grade) Matters
Sodium Bicarbonate, commonly known as baking soda, is a vital ingredient in animal nutrition. Its primary role is to act as a buffering agent, stabilizing pH levels in the digestive systems of livestock. This functionality is crucial, particularly for ruminants such as cows, sheep, and goats, as it helps prevent conditions like acidosis caused by imbalances in their feed.  
Key benefits of Sodium Bicarbonate for animal feed include:  
1. Improved Digestion: Regulates pH levels in the rumen, fostering better digestion and nutrient absorption.  
2. Enhanced Milk Production: In dairy cattle, it supports optimal rumen function, leading to higher milk yield and quality.  
3. Stress Reduction: Helps animals cope with dietary or environmental stress, maintaining their health and productivity.  
4. Cost-Efficiency: A natural, economical solution to maintaining livestock health.
